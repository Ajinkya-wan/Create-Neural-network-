Simple neural network

Overview
This is a single layer feedforward neural network (perceptron). We use binary digits as our inputs and expect binary digits as our outputs.Use of backpropagation(via gradient descent to train our network and make predictions more accurate.

Dependencies

numpy

Run ``python demo.py`` in terminal to see it train, then predict.
